## Abstract:
Crowdfunding has become a vital source of funding for non-governmental organizations (NGOs). However, the lack of transparency and accountability in traditional crowdfunding platforms can lead to mistrust and inefficiency. This study proposes a blockchain-based crowdfunding NGO management system that ensures transparency, security, and accountability. The system utilizes smart contracts to automate the crowdfunding process and provides a decentralized and immutable platform for fundraising. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in promoting transparency, accountability, and trust in crowdfunding for NGOs.

Keywords: Blockchain, Crowdfunding, NGO Management, Transparency, Accountability, Smart Contracts.
